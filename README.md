# About

The Ordinal News Standard is a convention for permanently inscribing news and topics of discussion to Bitcoin.

The benefit of doing this is to create an immutable record of who said what and when, with no stealth edits.

While nobody can revise what is written, they can add comments or updates using new inscriptions.

**Our community's mission is to move the news to the ledger of record.**

To inscribe the news, visit [https://inscribe.news/post-news](https://inscribe.news/post-news).

To view a news inscription, use either the inscription ID or number with the link format below:

* example: "The Tripolar Moment" by Balaji S. Srinivasan
