# About

The Ordinal News Standard is a standard for permanently inscribing news and topics of discussion to Bitcoin.

The goal is to create a unified way for Bitcoiners to inscribe news and tell their own story, independent from centralized institutions.\
\
See the [Operations](operations.md) section for more information on the protocol and how to use the standard.\

Visit [inscribe.news](https://inscribe.news) to write using the standard, or to view news inscriptions by ID, e.g.
